# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction tasks due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Load and preprocess historical stock price data.
- Model training: Train an LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
- Visualization: Plot the predicted and actual stock prices for comparison.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure you have the historical stock price data in a CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Training**: Train the LSTM model using the training script.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
5. **Visualization**: Plot the results to visualize the performance of the model.
